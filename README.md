**1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
   For this course, we learned different data structures and utilized a breakdown of each line of code and how long it would take to process the information for that code. Utilizing that information, we determined the Big O notation of each data structure and the different uses and implementation of them. This allowed us to choose an adequate data structure for our final coding endeavor of printing and organizing the course list.
   
**2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
   Approaching this problem, there were different pieces of information required to make an educated decision on which data structure could efficiently navigate our lists as well as create an adequate structure for what needed to be performed. By choosing a Search tree, I was able to allow for the list to become bigger as well as not compromise the speed of the data navigation. 
**3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
  To overcome roadblocks, I would typically look up any videos on how to do what I am trying to do. If there were no videos, I would go onto various forums to see if people had asked similar questions. For example, I believe this was the first time I had experienced the need for a destructor, so I looked up methods for creating a destructor for a Binary Search Tree. To my surprise, many people had similar questions, and many other people would give very good advice on how to approach the problem. If this hadn't worked, I would have asked peers, my instructor, or a friend of mine who works as a Software Engineer to guide me along the correct path.
**4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
  Another first was actually seeing how each of my different constructors and other functions interacted together to create a running program. I had done this before, but I feel like this was the first time I fully understood the scope of what my code was doing and how each line was interacting with the next. Some would call this their "Aha" moment, which is a nice thing to have happen.
**5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  I planned a lot more in this class than I had previously. This course showed me that planning each step will make the entire process a lot smoother in the long run. Furthermore, this class reiterated to me that I don't HAVE to know everything and its okay to ask peers for help.
